# Reddit Post: Should I Launch This Scroll Tracking SaaS?

## Title: "Built a scroll tracking SaaS - should I launch it? Need your thoughts!"

## Post Content:

Hey r/entrepreneur and r/SaaS!

I just built a scroll tracking platform called **ScrollSensie** and I'm wondering if it's worth launching. Would love your honest feedback!

## What it does:

- **Real-time scroll analytics** - Track how far users scroll on your website
- **Engagement metrics** - Time on page, scroll completion rates, active engagement
- **Live user tracking** - See visitors in real-time with location data
- **Device analytics** - Desktop, mobile, tablet breakdown
- **One-line integration** - Just add a script tag to any website

## Key Features:

‚úÖ **Scroll depth tracking** (25%, 50%, 75%, 100% milestones)  
‚úÖ **Live dashboard** with beautiful charts and real-time updates  
‚úÖ **User behavior insights** - who's actually reading vs just scrolling  
‚úÖ **Geographic data** - see where your visitors are from  
‚úÖ **Google OAuth** - easy signup/login  
‚úÖ **CSV export** - download your data anytime

## The Problem it Solves:

Most analytics tools tell you page views, but not if people actually _read_ your content. This helps you understand:

- Are people actually engaging with your content?
- Which pages keep users scrolling vs bouncing?
- What's your real engagement rate vs just traffic?

## My Questions:

1. **Is this a real problem** you face with your websites?
2. **What would you pay** for this kind of data? (thinking $9-29/month)
3. **What features** would make this a must-have for you?
4. **Should I focus on** bloggers, e-commerce, or SaaS companies?

## Demo:

You can test it live at: [scrollsensie.vercel.app](https://scrollsensie.vercel.app)

The tracking script works on any website - just add one line of code and you're tracking!

## What I'm worried about:

- Is this too niche?
- Are there already good solutions I'm missing?
- Should I pivot to a different angle?

**Honest feedback appreciated!** Even if you think it's a bad idea, I'd rather know now than waste months on something nobody wants.

Thanks for reading! üôè
